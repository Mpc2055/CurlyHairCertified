 Blog Feature Implementation Summary

  I've successfully implemented a complete blog feature for your Rochester curly hair site that aligns with your existing architecture patterns. Here's what was created:

  Backend (Complete)

  - Database schema (shared/schema.ts): Added blogPosts table with all necessary fields
  - API routes (server/routes.ts):
    - GET /api/blog/posts - List all posts with optional filtering
    - GET /api/blog/posts/:slug - Get single post by slug
    - GET /api/blog/featured - Get featured post
  - Storage methods (server/storage.ts): getBlogPosts(), getBlogPostBySlug(), getFeaturedBlogPost()

  Frontend (Complete)

  - API client (client/src/lib/api-client.ts): Typed blog API methods
  - Query keys (client/src/lib/query-keys.ts): Blog cache key factory
  - Hooks (client/src/hooks/api/useBlog.ts): usePosts(), usePost(), useFeaturedPost()
  - Components:
    - BlogCard.tsx - Post preview card
    - BlogErrorBoundary.tsx - Error handling
  - Pages:
    - /blog - List view with tag filtering
    - /blog/:slug - Individual post view with markdown rendering
  - Navigation: Added Blog link with BookOpen icon
  - Routes: Integrated into App.tsx

  Content Created

  Blog post: /blog-posts/why-we-built-this-for-rochester.md

  A comprehensive, research-backed first post (7 min read) that tells Colleen's story and explains:
  - The personal motivation behind building the site
  - The curly hair specialist shortage ($15.6B market, only 1 stylist per 32,000 people)
  - Why people with curly hair avoid salons (20% cry over bad haircuts)
  - The trust gap and common stylist mistakes
  - Why certifications matter (DevaCurl, Cadō, Rëzo)
  - Rochester's potential as a curly hair destination
  - All sources and references properly cited

  Next Steps

  You'll need to run migrations to create the blog_posts table, then insert the blog post from the markdown file into your database. The markdown file has frontmatter with all the metadata
   (slug, title, author, tags, etc.) you'll need.
